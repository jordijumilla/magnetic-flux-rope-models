# Magnetic Flux Rope Models

The __Magnetic Flux Rope Models__ is a `Python` package whose aim is to provide a simple and reliable way to work with analytical magnetic flux rope models. It can be used to simply
explore and visualise the models, simulate synthetic data from spacecraft or fit analytical models to actual magnetic objects.
It can also be used as artifical input for other processes such as the Grad-Shafranov reconstruction technique, or machine learning models.
