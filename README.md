# Magnetic Flux Rope Models (MFRM)

The __Magnetic Flux Rope Models__ is a `Python` package whose aim is to provide a simple and reliable way to work with analytical magnetic flux rope models. It can be used to simply
explore and visualise the models, and also as artifical input for other processes such as the Grad-Shafranov reconstruction technique, or machine learning models.

__Details__:
- 👨🏽‍💻 __Author & developer__: [Jordi Jumilla Lorenz](https://github.com/jordijumilla/jordijumilla).
- 🎓 __Associations__: this code has been developed independently of any university or institution. However, it can be thought as a continuation of the author's thesis: [Connecting the Grad-Shafranov reconstruction technique to flux-rope models](https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/370244), with association with Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
